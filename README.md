# Employee-Tracker

## Description

In this Project I created a terminal application using inquirer and MySQL so that a user can view, add, and update data pertaining to the database of employees. I learned to create unique CRUD operations in combination with clean terminal prompts. The user can not only talk to the database but also view its contents via console tables, fear not queries are protected via preffered statements.
